# ðŸ§  Brain CT Scan Classification â€“ Stroke vs Normal

This project focuses on classifying **brain CT scans** as either **normal** or **stroke-affected** using deep learning techniques. The main goal is to assist early medical diagnosis by leveraging an optimized **EfficientNetB2** architecture.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Inside
- A **Jupyter Notebook** that walks through:
  - Data preprocessing and augmentation steps.
  - Training a deep learning model with **EfficientNetB2**.
  - Hyperparameter tuning using **Keras Tuner**.
  - Model evaluation with metrics like **AUC** and **F1-score**.
- The notebook demonstrates a complete pipeline: from loading CT scan data to achieving a robust and accurate model.

## ðŸš€ Highlights
- **EfficientNetB2 Backbone** â€“ Used transfer learning for high performance.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization** â€“ Fine-tuned using Keras Tuner.
- **Data Augmentation** â€“ Applied techniques like rotation and flipping for better generalization.
- **Metrics** â€“ Evaluated the model using AUC and F1-score for reliable performance.
